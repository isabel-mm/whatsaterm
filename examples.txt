Boxplots are a common graphical way of depicting the spread of the data and use the IQR. The data that falls within the IQR will be in the box in the centre of the plot. The horizontal line across the box indicates the median. The so-called whiskers (made up of the dotted vertical lines and solid horizontal lines that go out from the box) mark the 1.5 IQR above the third quartile and below the first quartile. In a normal distribution, the whiskers will be of the same length; if they have different lengths then it is a sign that the distribution is skewed.

Párrafo 2:
Metadata is what distinguishes a corpus from a random collection of texts by giving it explicit structure: minimally any user of a corpus will know what amount of text data is contained in it, what characteristics texts have, for example, whether they are written for a newspaper or spoken during a conversation with friends or colleagues, who produced the text, and so on. This allows researchers to determine if the samples are representative of the population of interest.

Párrafo 3:
genre markers are the opening of certain speeches or announcements (Ladies and gentleman, Sehr geehrte Damen und Hereren, e raga sul) or letters (and emails) (Dear …, Liebe/r …). You could object that these formulas still serve some communicative function, at the least by announcing the type of text they also prepare recipients for their task, that is, to stop talking when a speech begins! But the exact form of the expressions in question is purely conventional (although they may historically be motivated). These are genre markers: linguistic features of genres are not pervasive, rather they occur often only once, in specific positions in a text. Often text varieties with specific genre properties are recognised as such in speech communities and cultures and receive a name, as in the examples in

While we will mostly be talking about restrictions on text data availability and usability for corpus building in this section, there is also the reverse deviation from the corpus design ideal, where a corpus can indeed be an exact copy of the population under consideration. Such population corpora are restricted to specific research contexts where a restricted set of texts is also the object of the research agenda. We mentioned this possibility in Chapter 2, namely, that someone interested in the specific properties of Obama' s published speeches could indeed consider all these speeches, and thus sampling is not necessary. A real example is

Corpus linguistics, at its heart, involves counting things. This can be very simple, like counting all the words in a corpus or a specific word within a corpus, but can also become very complicated. For instance, counting the number of times something happens under various conditions and then seeing if that is different from what we would expect if the distribution was completely random. This chapter will focus on a few kinds of statistical analyses that are often used in corpus linguistics and will try to get you in a position to turn a research question into something specific and testable. This chapter will explain some of the most frequently used quantitative techniques in corpus linguistics today, such as logistic mixed-effects regression, as well as focus on some newer techniques becoming more popular, such as classification trees (and random forests) which are types of recursive partitioning. We also present some basic types of clustering.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 6:
According to our design criteria and our generalised corpus-building scheme, we select and collect texts carefully following considerations of representativeness. This ideal is confronted by restrictions on data availability. Data availability can be restricted in all sorts of ways. Consider again the major difference between published and private texts: where a text is published it is fixed to some medium in some basic format, whether digital or analogue. Although the texts are accessible, there are copyright restrictions in both cases, which limits the availability of published texts for corpus-building enterprises severely. Even some texts available through the internet may have some copyright protection or restrictions on usage. Private texts, on the other hand, are not subject to copyright restrictions, but here participants who have produced the texts may be much less willing to make these publicly accessible. Often private texts will, therefore, never make it into a corpus. Where they are included, permission needs to be obtained and documented, often under the umbrella of a university's ethics administration and in the form of informed consent. Sometimes,

Párrafo 7:
Finally, we can classify corpora in terms of what languages they represent the usage of. For instance, we could in principle distinguish between corpora of European and African languages etc. (global language areas), or between those of Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages etc. (language families), and the like. While this is a fairly trivial reflection of groups of languages with little specific relevance for corpus linguistics, a grouping that is more important for our purposes is that between wellstudied and lesser-studied languages. This is relevant because it comes with various preconditions, and leads to different goals for corpus linguistic work. Well-studied languages often have already established large corpora, an established research tradition including descriptive and analytical work, etc. Lesser-studied languages typically lack these things, and here corpus linguistics often means to build corpora in the first instance, and these corpora will then often be relatively small, which then comes with various restrictions as to their usability in research. A further relevant distinction is that of minority language corpora, which relate to languages other than the official standard languages in big nation-states. A similar distinction is that between (standard) language and (regional or social) dialect corpora. Big reference corpora often target standard languages of big nation-states, but this need not be the case and there can also be big reference corpora of dialects or minority languages, for example, of Sorbian (a Slavic language of east Germany;

The first column has numerical identifiers of each corpus word form. The next one has the word form followed by lemma annotation. The fourth column hosts the universal PoS tag followed by a language-specific PoS tag, followed, in turn, by a list of language-specific grammatical features of the word form. The next column contains a number cross-referencing the word form ID in column 1 that identifies the head of which the word form in question is the dependent. For instance, in Table

Párrafo 9:
This brings us to the crucial feature of UDs, namely their cross-linguistic comparability. This is achieved primarily by including very general PoS tags as well as general definitions of dependency relations; specific dependencies as cross-referenced to heads, are not language-specific anyway. In this way, the research questions just outlined can be undertaken across any number of UDs. One can then, for example, compare the extent to which the order of say subject and object varies across languages, or to what extent their ordering is interrelated with their relative length and complexity.

Párrafo 10:
An apparent time study uses data from one time period within a variety of languages, but that includes data from language users of different ages. If older language users are doing something different than younger language users, it is taken to indicate that there has been a change in the linguistic community. Such differences could indicate that older people took up a change that younger people did not. But

(1) (6. The primary purpose of the transcription is to make the spoken text searchable. Without the transcription it would still be possible to find the same instances, but this would involve re-listening to the recordings and noting all relevant instances, a painstaking and unreliable procedure. The same applies to specific properties of speech production, for example, overlapping of speech or pausing: since these are captured as part of the transcription they are likewise searchable, for example, by using query expressions like the square brackets to extract instances of overlap or triple dots to find shorter pauses. Obviously in order to use these annotations, familiarity with the conventions is essential.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 12:
In a final step, we need to make the corpus accessible to the scientific community in order to fulfil the scientific imperative of accountability and to enable further scientific developments based thereupon. A further feature desirable from a scientific point of view may be modifiability or manipulability, that is, we may want to offer the opportunity to add further texts to the corpus as appropriate in given research contexts or to modify the corpus composition in other ways (e.g. by removing some texts, etc.). We will discuss different ways to achieve these goals in the following section.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 13:
Regional sociolinguistic corpus research often focuses on the features that are associated with a specific dialect. Like any linguistic community, a particular regional community is not a monolith and we expect variation according to age, gender, education levels, attitudes, etc. Further, a feature that may be strongly associated with a particular community can still have predictable variation within that community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 14:
In linguistics we distinguish between linguistic knowledge and language use. For instance, speakers of a given language know what sounds distinguish words, what words or constructions mean, or on what occasion to use which expression. Language use refers to what speakers do with language and how they act in a given society by using language. In contrast to linguistic knowledge, language use is directly observable and recordable, and the texts in a corpus essentially comprise such records of language use. The corpus-linguistic approach is the systematic study of language use represented by the texts in corpora, which targets both linguistic knowledge and language use. The insights into linguistic knowledge that we gain from corpora are highly relevant in lexicography (the compilation and writing of dictionaries and lexical databases), for the writing of descriptive grammars of languages, or in anthropological linguistics where one aim of researchers is to establish the connections between linguistic and cultural knowledge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 15:
The next dimension of text varieties is genre. Text genres are defined not by their situational features but by specific linguistic features that are conventionally used and not clearly motivated by communicative functions. A classic example is the genre of fairy tales in the European literary tradition: not only do these have a very clearly defined narrative structure but they also have conventionalised opening and closing formulas, as shown in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 16:
We know from previous research that for many variables, most people do not use one variant exclusively. People use mostly one variant (as with an indicator) or mostly one variant in a particular situation (as with a marker). The distribution is probabilistic. Some people have a higher probability of using one variant over another in a particular context, and that context may have to do with their interlocutor, the situation, the topic of conversation, or more. A corpus approach can be used then, in conjunction with a sociolinguistic question, to describe the distribution of the variants across such external contextual features. To be able to assess these factors properly, good metadata is needed about the language users as well as good metadata or annotations about each specific context of use.

Vera' a community members expressed concern over younger generations not having any knowledge of the names of floral and faunal species and the details of their specific features and uses. So, in addition to the more common texts from oral literature (myths, legends, fables) we also collected more than 100 plants and over 200 fish descriptions. We first recorded spoken texts, and one community linguist created edited versions based on the original recording together with its transcription. Similarly, two community linguists wrote up descriptions of bird species, and a smaller group of speakers created a mono-lingual encyclopaedic dictionary with definitions of parts of a house. Descriptive texts of this kind are not part of the traditional verbal behaviour of the community. Yet, their inclusion in the corpus does serve the community' s interest. Crucially, the descriptive texts formed part of the basis of our comparative study of object realisation in Vera' a

For special corpora, it is more of an issue to determine clearly the exact limitations of the intended population of texts. This is relatively straightforward in the case of superspecialised ATC corpora: they include only those texts produced over the specific pilot-controller channel over shifting radio frequencies, which are in fact explicitly announced by controllers and confirmed by pilots. In other contexts, the situation is more intricate: an example is the work of Douglas Biber and colleagues who famously investigated English language use in US universities, their 'university language' . They describe the scope of the language use under investigation as "[…] the range of spoken and written registers that students encounter in U.S. universities and of the major academic disciplines […]"

Párrafo 19:
The authors point out that the act of reference is about directing attention to something to establish it as a concept for further commentary and then using our semiotic repertoire to characterise it in some way. The repertoire of devices available will differ based on the mode of communication. For instance, pointing is available (to both signers and speakers) in face-to-face communication, but not in writing. In many studies of reference in spoken languages, researchers (including your textbook authors) have focused on distinctions between lexical NPs, pronouns, and zeros for referent expression. They tend to look at predictors such as salience, accessibility, referential distance, and animacy to explain the choice of one type of reference over another. In signed language studies of reference, researchers have looked at different strategies such as pronominal pointing, indicating signs, depicting signs, NPs, and enactment. They also focus on issues such as the grammatical role and cognitive accessibility to investigate which strategies are used.

For language archives, one will either have to fill in metadata forms, for instance, the metadata catalogue of PARADISEC (catalog.paradisec.org.au/), or adhere to a standard metadata format, for instance in the DoBeS (tla.mpi.nl/project/dobes/) or the ELAR (soas. ac.uk/elar/) archive. The latter two use a standard called IMDI. IMDI files can be generated easily via an online interface called CMDI Maker (cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de/) where one can fill in the information relating to participants, circumstances of individual sessions, overall project, etc. as discussed above. This gives standardised metadata results, among other things, in the data appearing on the archive' s website in a structured way.

The Brown tagset also picks up specific forms that are particularly relevant for the analysis of grammatical (sentence) structure, thus breaching strict assumptions of word class membership; this is typical of tagsets for English. For instance, different forms of the verbs be, have, and do receive their own specific tags lacking an initial V for classification as verbs, as shown in Table

Corpus composition and corpus types 35 members. Typically, L2 texts produced by learners would not be included in a general corpus of the respective language, which in principle raises interesting questions (not to be discussed here), like who counts as a member of a language community? Several special corpora contain only specific types of text, which could also be included in a general corpus. For instance, the Corpus of Supreme Court Opinions (cf. the list in Table

Párrafo 23:
Representativeness refers to the identity in distribution of linguistic and situational features of language use found in the corpus (the sample) and real-life language use (the population). A corpus can be representative of all the possible linguistic features of a language (covering all possible structures that are part of language user's competence), or it can be representative of all the external or situational variables of different texts that are produced in a given language. Representativeness is essentially unattainable given that we can never know what the population really looks like (and unlike pollsters we never have anything like election results come in against which we could evaluate our sampling procedures). We, therefore, take a melioristic approach where we outline ways in which corpora can fare better or worse in regards to representativeness, focusing on the previously mentioned corpus parameters.

Levshina 2015:261-263 for more on this). The coefficients will be either positive or negative. In a linear regression model, positive and negative values have clear mappings: IVs or levels of the IV that make the DV smaller (for instance make a word shorter) will be negative, IVs or levels of the IV that make the DV larger will be positive. For logistic regression, positive or negative will reflect either an increase or decrease (respectively) of the probability of the reference level of the outcome variable. With our Vera'a argument expression, positive coefficients show an increase in the probability of the IV being associated with pronoun use.

Statistical description and analysis 160 and variable combinations will result in potentially different variables performing well (sometimes animacy of the referent, sometimes person, etc.); one will be the best factor most often for predicting the outcome of the DV. This one factor will be ranked higher than the others in a variable importance ranking. A conditional permutation of the variable importance ranking, although computationally costly, ensures that the evaluation of a variable's importance takes into consideration its behaviour in relation to other variables in its ranking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 26:
As with function words, grammatical marking can be a fruitful area of study even in a small corpus because it tends to be obligatory and frequent, although this obviously depends on the language of study. If there is a presence or absence of grammatical marking due to certain context features, this can be appropriate for a corpus study, particularly as part of the language description processes. For instance, is object marking optional? Does it occur with some persons or numbers more often than others? A related question is the variable realisation of objects as either pronoun or zero, and in 8.4 we have presented such a corpus-based study for Vera' a in some detail. Grammatical marking can also be studied in terms of co-occurrence. What kinds of verbs co-occur most often with imperfective versus perfective aspects and how do the aspects change the meanings of verbs?

structures, is in turn embedded in a larger chunk of text, also made up of linguistic structures. All texts also have language-external contexts, which comprise all physical, social, and cultural aspects of the situation in which texts are situated. For instance, Obama's speech took place at the White House, on 14 June 2016, in front of an audience of 5,000 people, with him on the stage speaking into a microphone so that his voice was louder than the cheering and the comments shouted out by the audience. Obama as the speaker comes with specific socially and culturally significant features: he was president of the United States at the time, he is from Hawaii, lived in Indonesia, Chicago, and elsewhere, is an adult male who natively speaks American English, is black, is a cis-gendered, straight male, among many other identifying aspects. Likewise, the members of the audience have specific social features, and it is by now well-established that the audience a language producer has in mind can bear on the way they speak, sign, or write (cf.

Many phonological research questions will use phonemically transcribed corpora. Rather than basing analyses on acoustic measurements, like with speech corpora research, the analyses are based on the phonemic transcriptions. For some languages, the written words are similar enough to their phonemic representations that text corpora can be used to examine questions relating to phonology. Below we give an example of corpus research on Tagalog phonology

Párrafo 29:
Raw spoken-language texts cannot generally be analysed as such with standard corpus-linguistic tools and are therefore transcribed, that is, transposed into a written form, before they are included in a corpus. This written form is what we treat as the corpus text since this is what can be searched and further annotated. The major goal is to provide an accurate rendition of the spoken text in written form, including certain paralinguistic aspects. Transcription may be at a low level of granularity, transcribing only speech streams, or highly detailed including laughter, lengthening, breathiness, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Párrafo 30:
The actual distribution of such forms across texts of different modes is beyond the discussion in this chapter and is more a matter of systematic register studies, such as those mentioned in 3.1.6. What is relevant for our purposes here is that corpus and tagset developers entertain a considerable degree of freedom in designing tagsets to serve their specific needs, so that tags do not necessarily reflect the absolute exactness of linguistic analysis and classification. In other words, the maxim for the development of tagsets -and annotation systems more generally -is not that they are linguistically 100% accurate but that they are useful and overall consistent in their operationalisation.
